Made for the example provided from https://github.com/struct/mms
*Remember to look through the slides they provide as they do discuss some of the bugs/vulnerabilities that are throughout the examples

Compiled with Visual Studio 2017 via the "win_compile.bat" file in the directory.

Target: Windows 7 x86

Goal:
Fix bugs that prevent the program from running, choose and keep vulnerabilities that will allow code execution.
*Sort of like two games in one really.

Notes:
I added my fixed version of the ipc_recv.cpp as "ipc_recv_fixed.cpp" if you wish to skip to the exploit part. 

How-to-Run:
ipc_recv.exe obj
*This will create a shared memory channel called obj

Exploit Script How-to-Run:
createData.py <command>

CommandList:
validate: Must validate before continuing
blob: Code execution bug
set_key: Sets Crypto key
get_key: Gets Crypto key
dump_data: Used to grab data
crypto_set_key: Test of the crash
ping: Leap of the heap in PING
get_heap_leak: combine with ping to get the base pointer of the current top of the heap
read_file: Read file setup for the IPC shared memory
write_file: Write file setup for the IPC shared memory
rop: Creates the rop payload to pop calc.exe on the target
check: Checks to see if the shared memory channel is open

Tools:
cscope
windbg
IDA
idasploit
